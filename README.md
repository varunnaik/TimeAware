# Time Aware

This extension helps you stop wasting time on the web.
Create a blocklist with the top websites you generally spend time on.
See the total time spent on that site in a counter at the bottom as you browse.
Instead of outright blocking the website, this helps make you aware of how much of your life you spend there, motivating you to quit.
